# PhonePe_Project
This project was completed to develop skills in data extraction, Data transformation, Database insertion, Dashboard creation, Data retrieval, Deployment.

Data Extraction: Utilize scripting to clone the PhonePe Pulse GitHub repository, enabling the retrieval of raw data.
Store the acquired data in a structured format, such as CSV or JSON, for further processing and analysis.

Data Transformation: Employ a scripting language, particularly Python, coupled with data manipulation libraries like Pandas, to conduct data preprocessing.
Tasks within this step encompass data cleaning, handling missing values, and restructuring the data to prepare it for analytical and visualization tasks.

Database Insertion: Utilize the "mysql-connector-python" library in Python to establish a connection with a MySQL database.
Execute SQL commands to insert the transformed data into the database, ensuring that it aligns with the database schema.

Dashboard Creation: Harness the capabilities of Python libraries such as Streamlit and Plotly to craft an interactive and visually appealing dashboard.
Leverage Plotly's integrated geospatial mapping functions to display data on maps.
Employ Streamlit to design a user-friendly interface with dynamic dropdown options for users to select and visualize different datasets and insights.

Data Retrieval: Implement the "mysql-connector-python" library to establish a connection with the MySQL database.
Retrieve data from the database into Pandas dataframes, making the data readily available for dashboard updates.

Deployment: Prioritize the security, efficiency, and user-friendliness of the solution. Deploy the dashboard in a public domain, ensuring accessibility to users for data exploration and visualization.

This technical approach ensures a comprehensive pipeline for data acquisition, transformation, storage, visualization, and deployment, enabling users to explore and gain insights from the PhonePe Pulse data effectively.
